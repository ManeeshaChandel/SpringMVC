So the main difference between a server and a servlet is that a server is a computer program
 or a machine that responds to requests from clients over a network,
 while a servlet is a Java class that runs on a server and processes requests from clients
 to provide dynamic content for web applications.

 A Scriptlet, on the other hand, is a part of a JSP (JavaServer Pages) page
 that allows Java code to be embedded directly into the HTML content.
 It is a way to generate dynamic content for web pages using Java code.
 The Scriptlet is enclosed in <% %> tags and can be used to include Java code snippets,
 which can be used to generate dynamic content, interact with databases, or perform other tasks.
